# BARTRides

This project is meant to look over BART ridership overtime. I got the idea from Victor Geislinger's ["BART Ridership"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrgeislinger/bartridership?select=READ%2520ME.txt) repository on Kaggle. Geislinger mentions that BART provided the [source](http://64.111.127.166/origin-destination/) for their data so I pulled the data from BART.
